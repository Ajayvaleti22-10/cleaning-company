          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mb-4">1. Services</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Sparkright Cleaning provides residential and commercial cleaning services (“Services”).
            Service scope is limited to the package and add-ons selected at booking and confirmed in
            writing (confirmation email/SMS/invoice). We may decline or stop service if conditions are
            unsafe or outside the agreed scope.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mb-4">2. Quotes, Pricing & Changes</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Quotes are based on information you provide (property size, condition, frequency, and
            add-ons). Pricing may change if on-site conditions materially differ (e.g., excessive
            clutter, heavy soiling, pet waste, additional rooms not disclosed). If additional work is
            requested or required, we will confirm any price change before proceeding whenever
            possible.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mb-4">3. Scheduling, Access & Preparation</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            You are responsible for providing safe access at the scheduled time (keys, codes, parking
            instructions). Please secure valuables and personal items and disclose any special
            instructions, pets, or alarms. If we cannot access the property, the appointment may be
            treated as a late cancellation/no-show.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mb-4">4. Cancellations & No-Shows</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Cancellations or reschedules must be made at least <strong>24 hours</strong> before the
            appointment to avoid fees. Late cancellations or no-shows may be charged up to{" "}
            <strong>50%</strong> of the scheduled service price. Repeated late cancellations/no-shows
            may require prepayment for future bookings.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mb-4">5. Payment Terms</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Payment is due upon completion of service unless otherwise agreed in writing. Accepted
            payment methods and any applicable fees (e.g., parking, after-hours) will be provided at
            booking or on the invoice.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mb-4">6. Satisfaction Policy</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            If you are not satisfied, please notify us within <strong>24 hours</strong> with details.
            Our primary remedy is a re-clean of the missed areas. Refunds, if any, are limited to the
            affected portion of the service except where prohibited by law.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mb-4">7. Safety & Hazardous Conditions</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            We do not provide biohazard cleanup, mold remediation, pest extermination, or handling of
            hazardous/illegal materials unless explicitly agreed in writing and legally permitted. We
            may refuse or stop service if conditions are unsafe.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mb-4">8. Damage & Liability</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Please report any alleged damage within <strong>48 hours</strong> of service completion
            with photos when possible. We are not responsible for pre-existing damage, normal wear,
            or items that were unstable/fragile/not disclosed. To the maximum extent permitted by
            law, our total liability is limited to the amount paid for the specific service giving
            rise to the claim (or $100 if none), except where prohibited by law.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mb-4">9. Website Use</h2>
